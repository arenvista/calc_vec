# Line Equation

The vector equation of a line in three-dimensional space can be expressed as:

#### Equation 1
$$ \mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{r}_0 + t \mathbf{v} $$

where:
- $\mathbf{r}(t)$ is the position vector of a point on the line as a function of the parameter $t$.
- $\mathbf{r}_0$ is the position vector of a specific point on the line.
- $\mathbf{v}$ is the direction vector of the line.
- $t$ is a scalar parameter.

This equation represents a line that passes through the point given by $\mathbf{r}_0$ and is parallel to the vector $\mathbf{v}$. By varying the value of $t$, different points on the line can be obtained.

#### Equation 2

$$ \frac{x-x_o}{a} = \frac{y-y_o}{b} = \frac{z-z_o}{c}$$

$x$, $y$, $z$ are the coordinates of any point on the line. $x_0$, $y_0$, $z_0$ are the coordinates of the specific point on the line given by $\mathbf{r}_0$. $a$, $b$, $c$ are the components of the direction vector $\mathbf{v}$.

#### Equation(s) 3

$$x = x_o + at$$
$$y = y_o + bt$$
$$z = z_o + ct$$
