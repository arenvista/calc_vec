# Projections

To find the projection of one vector $\mathbf{a}$ onto another vector $\mathbf{b}$, use the formula:

$$
\text{proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b}} \mathbf{b}
$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}$ is the dot product of vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$.
- $\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b}$ is the dot product of vector $\mathbf{b}$ with itself, which is the square of the magnitude of $\mathbf{b}$.

This formula gives the vector projection of $\mathbf{a}$ onto $\mathbf{b}$, which is a vector that is parallel to $\mathbf{b}$.

**Notice we are taking the inner product of two vectors and multiplying by a vector**

This is akin to finding the down-cast shadow of a onto b
