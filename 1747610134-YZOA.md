# Binormal Vector
To find the binormal vector, which is perpendicular to both the tangent and normal vectors of a curve, we use the formula:

$$ \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{T} \times \mathbf{N} $$

where $\mathbf{T}$ is the tangent vector, $\mathbf{N}$ is the normal vector, and $\times$ denotes the cross product. The binormal vector $\mathbf{B}$ is then normalized to have a unit magnitude.

You can determine the direction of the binormal vector $\mathbf{B}$ using the left-hand rule for cross products. Position your left hand such that your index finger points in the direction of the tangent vector $\mathbf{T}$, and your middle finger points in the direction of the normal vector $\mathbf{N}$. Your thumb will then point in the direction of the binormal vector $\mathbf{B}$. This rule helps visualize the orientation of the vectors in a left-handed coordinate system.
