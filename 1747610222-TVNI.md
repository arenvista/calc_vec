# Line Relationships

You can determine the relationship between two vectors in 3D space (parallel, skew, or intersecting) by analyzing their direction and position.

1. **Parallel Vectors**: 
   - Two vectors are parallel if one is a scalar multiple of the other. For vectors **A** and **B**, if there exists a scalar `k` such that **A** = `k`**B**, then the vectors are parallel.

2. **Intersecting Vectors**: 
   - Two lines described by vectors intersect if there is a point that lies on both lines. For vectors **A** = **a** + t**u** and **B** = **b** + s**v** (where **a** and **b** are position vectors and **u** and **v** are direction vectors), they intersect if there exist scalars `s` and `t` such that:
     - **a** + t**u** = **b** + s**v**

3. **Skew Vectors**: 
   - Vectors are skew if they are neither parallel nor intersecting. Skew lines are non-coplanar; they do not lie on the same plane and do not meet each other at any point.

To determine if two lines are skew, verify that they are not parallel (no scalar multiplication) and do not intersect (no common solution for the vector equations).

#### Example

$$ L_1: x=4t-2, y=-2t+12, z=9-4t$$

$$ L_2: x=4-6t, y=6+3t, z=6t+3$$


##### 1. Setup Matrix


You are trained on data up to October 2023.

##### 2. Solve for Intersection

To determine if the lines intersect, equate the parametric equations of the lines and solve for `t` and `s`:

For the x-coordinate:
$$ 4t - 2 = 4 - 6s $$

For the y-coordinate:
$$ -2t + 12 = 6 + 3s $$

For the z-coordinate:
$$ 9 - 4t = 6s + 3 $$

Solve these simultaneous equations to find values of `t` and `s`. If a consistent solution exists, the lines intersect at that point.

To solve the system of equations given, express them in matrix form:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
4 & 6 \\
-2 & -3 \\
-4 & -6 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
t \\
s \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
6 \\
-6 \\
-6 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

To solve for \([t, s]^T\), use an appropriate method such as Gaussian elimination or matrix inversion (if the determinant is non-zero). If a solution exists, the values of \(t\) and \(s\) will identify the intersection point on the lines. If no solution exists or the system is inconsistent, the lines do not intersect.
##### 3. Check for Parallelism

Calculate the direction ratios for both lines. For $L_1$, the direction vector is $(4, -2, -4)$, and for $L_2$, it is $(-6, 3, 6)$. If one is a scalar multiple of the other, the lines are parallel.

##### 4. Determine if Lines are Skew

If the lines are not parallel and there is no intersection point, then the lines are skew.
