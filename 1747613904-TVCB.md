# Normal Component of Acceleration

To find the normal component of acceleration, you can use the relationship between the tangential and normal components in the context of the motion along a path. The normal component of acceleration, denoted as $a_n$, is associated with the change in direction of the velocity vector, and is perpendicular to the tangential component. 

Mathematically, the normal component can be calculated using the formula:

$$a_n = \frac{v^2}{\rho}$$

where $v$ is the magnitude of the velocity vector, and $\rho$ is the radius of curvature of the path. The radius of curvature measures how sharply a curve bends, and is defined as the reciprocal of the curvature $k$:

$$\rho = \frac{1}{k}$$

The curvature $k$ at a point on a curve can be calculated as:

$$k = \frac{|\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{a}|}{|\mathbf{v}|^3}$$

where $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity vector and $\mathbf{a}$ is the acceleration vector.

Thus, the normal component of acceleration is directly related to the curvature of the path and the square of the speed at that point.
