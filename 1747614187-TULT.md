# Curvature

The curvature $\kappa$ of a curve is given by the formula:
$$ \kappa = \frac{\|r'(t) \times r''(t)\|}{\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|} $$

- Curvature $\kappa$ measures how quickly a curve changes direction at a given point.
- For a parametric curve defined by the position vector $\mathbf{r}(t)$:
  - The derivative $\mathbf{r}'(t)$ represents the tangent vector to the curve at point $t$.
  - The second derivative $\mathbf{r}''(t)$ gives the rate of change of the tangent vector.
- The cross product $\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)$ results in a vector whose magnitude indicates the rate of change of the direction of $\mathbf{r}'(t)$, related to the bending of the curve.
- Dividing by $\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|^3$ normalizes this rate by the cube of the magnitude of the velocity vector, ensuring the curvature is scale-invariant.
- The resulting formula expresses curvature as the magnitude of the change in the tangent vector per unit length of the curve.
