# Linear Approximation

To find the linear approximation of a function $f(x)$ at a point $a$, use the formula:

$$ L(x) = f(a) + f'_x(a,b)(x - a) $$

- $L(x)$ is the linear approximation.
- $f(a)$ is the value of the function at $a$.
- $f'(a)$ is the derivative of the function at $a$.
- This linear function provides an estimate of $f(x)$ near the point $a$.

#### Example 

Use an appropriate linear approximation to estimate the value of $((3.02)^2 - 3(0.97))^2$

##### 1st Find $f(x,y)$
$$f(x,y) = ((x)^2 - 3(y))^2$$
$$\therefore f(3.02,0.97) = ((3.02)^2 - 3(0.97))^2$$

> *Recall*: values of a are associated with the values in f

##### 2nd Find f(a,b) Approximation Values
$$\therefore f(a,b) = ((3)^2 - 3(1))^2 = (9 - 3)^2 = (6)^2 = 36$$

##### 3rd Find $f_x, f_y$
$$f_x = 4x (x^2 - 3y) \implies f_x(a,b) = 4(3) (3^2 - 3(1)) = 72$$
$$f_y = 6(x^2 - 3y) = -6(3^2 - 3(1)) = -36$$

##### 4th Construct L(x,y)

$$ L(x,y) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + f'(b)(y-b) $$
$$ L(x,y) = 36 + f'_x(a,b)(0.2) + f'_y(a,b)(-0.03) $$
$$ L(x,y) = 36 + [36](0.2) + [72](-0.03) $$
$$36+1.44+1.08 = 38.52$$
