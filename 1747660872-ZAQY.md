# Evaluating Critical Points
To evaluate critical points in multivariate calculus, follow these steps:

1. **Find the Gradient**: Compute the gradient of the function $f(x, y)$ by taking the partial derivatives with respect to each variable:
   $$
   \nabla f(x, y) = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right).
   $$

2. **Set the Gradient to Zero**: Solve the system of equations given by setting each component of the gradient to zero:
   $$
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0.
   $$

3. **Solve for Critical Points**: Find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equations from step 2. These values are your critical points.

4. **Second Derivative Test**: To classify each critical point, compute the second partial derivatives:
   $$
   D = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} - \left(\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y}\right)^2.
   $$
   - If $D > 0$ and $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} > 0$, then the critical point is a local minimum.
   - If $D > 0$ and $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} < 0$, then the critical point is a local maximum.
   - If $D < 0$, then the critical point is a saddle point.
   - If $D = 0$, the test is inconclusive.

5. **Evaluate the Function**: Finally, evaluate the function $f(x, y)$ at each critical point to determine its value relative to other nearby points.

By following these steps, you can effectively evaluate and classify critical points in multivariate calculus.

#### Example 

Let $f(x,y) = x^3 - 3xy + y^3$. $f$ has a critical point at $(1,1)$î€‘ What does the second derivative test say about $f$ at this point?

##### 1st Find $f_{xx}, f_{yy}, f_{xy}$

$$f_x = 3x^2 - 3y$$
$$f_{xx} = 6x$$
$$f_y = -3x + 3y^2$$
$$f_{yy} = 6y$$
$$f_{xy} = -3$$

$$D = f_{xx}f_{yy} - f_{xy}^2 = 36 - 9 = 27 > 0$$
$$\text{Observe } f_{xx} = 6 > 0 \therefore f \text{ has a local minimum at } (1,1)$$
