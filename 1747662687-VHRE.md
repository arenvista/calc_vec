# Finding Critical Points

Recall in elementary calculus we say that critical points for a function $f$ are defined where $f'$ is zero. 

To find critical points in vector calculus, is similar, follow these steps:

1. **Define the function**: Let $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be a differentiable function.

2. **Compute the gradient**: Calculate the gradient of the function, denoted as $\nabla f$. The gradient is a vector of partial derivatives:
   $$ \nabla f = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}, \ldots, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} \right) $$

3. **Set the gradient to zero**: To find critical points, solve the equation:
   $$ \nabla f = 0 $$

4. **Solve the system of equations**: This results in a system of equations that you must solve to find the critical points.

5. **Classify the critical points**: Use the second derivative test or the Hessian matrix:
   $$ H(f) = \begin{bmatrix}
   \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1^2} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} & \cdots \\
   \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2 \partial x_1} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2^2} & \cdots \\
   \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
   \end{bmatrix} $$
   - If the Hessian is positive definite at a critical point, it is a local minimum.
   - If negative definite, it is a local maximum.
   - If indefinite, the point is a saddle point.

By following these steps, you will be able to identify and classify critical points of the function in vector calculus.

**This works for finding critical points inside the interior of the function to find the critical points along the edge of the function refer to [[1747663699-ZLMG|LeGrange]]
